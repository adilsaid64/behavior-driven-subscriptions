# Behavior Driven Subscriptions

Goal: Convert free users into paid members. The objective is to identify customers that are most likely not to enroll in the paid products, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the costs of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody. Especiaally customers who are likely to enroll anyway.

The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset. Typically, this type of data is proprietary and specific to each company. However, the patterns and insights derived from this analysis closely resemble real-world scenarios.
