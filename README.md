# Behavior Driven Subscriptions

Goal: Convert free users into paid members. The objective is to identify customers that are most likely not to enroll in the paid products, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the costs of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody. Especiaally customers who are likely to enroll anyway.

This project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a simulated dataset of app behavior to gain insights into the relationships between variables. Key features such as "numscreens," "minigame," and "used_premium_feature" were examined for their correlation with the target variable, "enrolled." Through EDA, it was found that "numscreens" had a moderate positive correlation with enrollment, indicating that users who interacted with more screens were more likely to subscribe. Feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance the predictive power of the model, including the creation of new features based on user engagement and demographic information. By using a logistic regression model, the project aimed to predict customer subscriptions in order to leverage the insights gained and effectively target non-subscribers.

The dataset used in this project is a simulated dataset. Typically, this type of data is proprietary and specific to each company. However, the patterns and insights derived from this analysis closely resemble real-world scenarios.
